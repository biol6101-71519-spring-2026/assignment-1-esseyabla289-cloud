I am Esinam Abla Akorli, a current 2nd Year PhD student in the McMillan lab. I come from Ghana in West Africa.  
My research interests involve exploring bacteria and their products as mosquito vector control tools. Mosquitoes transmit deadly pathogens
and are responsible for the most of the arthropod related diseases in the world. Bacteria are excellent sources of secondary metabolites that have insecticidal properties. These products can have larvicidal(larval-killing) properties against mosquitoes. I intend to explore that possibility.  
Personal interests include listening to KPOP music and playing with dogs (I have five dogs back home in Ghana).
Fun fact: I am fun to be around with.
